# Comparison of user - defined data sets on different data structures

This project, "Comparison of User-Defined Data Sets on Different Data Structures," provides a platform that enables users to create, manage, and analyze their own data sets using various data structures. The backend is built using Java, while Python libraries are utilized for graphical representation. This project helps users compare different data structures and determine the best one for their specific data set. Additionally, it features a notepad for users to make notes while visualizing and learning.

# Problem Statement 

The field of computer science and software development relies heavily on the efficient utilization of data structures. Data structures form the foundation upon which algorithms are built, making them a critical component in developing performant and scalable software solutions. However, aspiring programmers and computer science learners often face significant challenges in comprehending the practical implications of different data structures when working with their own data sets.

# Key Challenges 

**1. Theoretical vs. Practical Gap:** Many learners acquire theoretical knowledge of data structures but struggle to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation. Understanding how data structures perform with real-world data sets is essential for effective problem-solving.

**2. Selection Dilemma:** Choosing the appropriate data structure for a given problem is a fundamental decision in software development. Learners often lack practical experience in making informed decisions regarding data structure selection, resulting in suboptimal solutions.

**3. Lack of Hands-On Experience:** Traditional educational approaches often focus on theoretical explanations and lack opportunities for learners to engage in hands-on experimentation with data structures. Practical experience is crucial for developing proficiency.

**4. Complexity of Data Structures:** Data structures such as trees, graphs, and hash tables can be complex and abstract. Learners may find it challenging to comprehend their practical utility and performance characteristics without interactive experiences.

**5. Educational Tools Gap:** Existing educational tools and resources may not adequately address the need for hands-on, user-defined data set experimentation with different data structures. As a result, learners may struggle to gain a practical understanding of these concepts.

# Platform Demonstration
